# Homework 1 — Regex + NLP Preprocessing

## Your Task

Choose **any text** you like (≈300–1000 words). Examples: a news article, blog post, product page, a few short reviews/tweets (pasted together), a public-domain book excerpt, or your own writing.

> If using a website, **copy/paste the text** into your notebook or a `.txt` cell/block—no scraping required.

## Requirements

1. **Data & context** — briefly describe the text source and why you chose it (2–3 sentences).
2. **Regex extraction** — implement **≥3** patterns (e.g., emails, dates, phone numbers, hashtags, URLs, numbers). Show matches and 1–2 lines on accuracy/edge cases.
3. **NLP preprocessing** — tokenize → lowercase → remove stop words → **stem or lemmatize** (pick one and say why). Show top **15 tokens** after preprocessing.
4. **Regex + NLP combo** — one small combined extraction (e.g., `(number, following-noun)` pairs or simple entity/product extraction) with a short comment.
5. **Visualization** — one simple chart (e.g., bar chart of top tokens).
6. **Reproducibility** — notebook runs top-to-bottom with the chosen text included (pasted or as a short `.txt` cell).
7. **Comments** — brief comments explaining each step.
8. **Report** — a short summary (≤200 words) of your approach, challenges, and findings.
